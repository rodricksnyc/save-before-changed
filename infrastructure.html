					<p>A hallmark of NSF INCLUDES is the use of the five design elements of collaborative infrastructure, a process by which partner organizations (1) engage their community to formulate a shared vision of what can be accomplished collaboratively; (2) provide a platform for collaborative action; (3) develop common goals, objectives, metrics, and data collection procedures to measure shared progress and inform decision making; (4) develop structures across partner organizations to enhance coordination, communication, and visibility; and (5) establish the capacity for the expansion, sustainability, and scaling of their shared efforts. Each NSF INCLUDES project uses this framework to accelerate its efforts to address systemic barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM.<button type="button" class="blue strong highlight" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#survey"> Learn about the Hub’s Collaborative Infrastructure Survey <i aria-hidden="true" class="far fa-window-restore"></i></button>

								<p>NSF INCLUDES projects identify a common agenda that reflects a collective understanding of the BP challenge and links to existing research, promising practices, and/or to the previous and ongoing activities of partnering organizations. Large scale networks and partnerships develop a strategic plan to address the BP challenges, including technical infrastructure, which facilitates the implementation of a set of specified activities to achieve targeted outcomes. <em>(Source: NSF Program Solicitation 19-600.)</em></p>
								<p>The graphics below portray survey findings for <em><span class="strong">Shared Vision</span></em> using <em>respondents</em> as the unit of analysis. In addition to showing results for <em>all</em> survey respondents (i.e., Overall), the charts disaggregate data by the number of years that have elapsed since a respondents’ projects first received NSF INCLUDES funding (i.e., Year 2 or Year 3 of Project Funding). The use of Year of Project Funding allows us to examine which aspects of Shared Vision projects are addressing at a given point in their life cycle.</p>

								<p class="white">Because the survey was administered for the first time in spring 2021, we presently have no data on respondents’ perceptions of progress at the end of the first year of NSF INLCUDES funding. Going forward, we will obtain Year 1 data from initiatives that are just beginning their work on an NSF INCLUDES-funded project.) As such, we are currently unable to provide information about the relative progress that respondents would have reported for their initial year.</p>
								<p class="white">In theory, one would expect that Alliances with more years of NSF INCLUDES funding would report more progress around the operationalization of a given design element. However, we are somewhat cautious when making such comparisons because it is possible that the characteristics of Alliances funded in a given cohort differ (e.g., in terms of the maturity and complexity of their partnership structure, the range of barriers they are designed to address, the characteristics of their participant population, and the complexity of their approach). In addition, respondents’ perspectives concerning their accomplishments (or the progress they still need to make) about a given design element may shift as they recognize the complexity of a given issue—with respondents realizing more work is needed as they begin to delve more deeply into a particular task.</p>

					<p>The Hub’s Collaborative Infrastructure (CI) Survey is designed to collect information about the progress that NSF INCLUDES-funded projects are making addressing specific components of the design elements of collaborative infrastructure. A primary purpose of the survey is to highlight the progress that NSF INCLUDES-funded projects are making in developing a cohesive collaborative infrastructure as they operationalize the five design elements of collaborative infrastructure. In addition, the individual projects that participated in the survey are using their own data to assess their progress and inform their decision making. Going forward, the findings will serve as a resource for partnership projects that are seeking information about what constitutes a cohesive infrastructure (and how to measure progress toward having a cohesive infrastructure).</p>
					<p>Six of the eight Alliances participated in the initial administration of this web-based survey (the other two opted out because they already administer similar surveys but provided the Hub with their survey data). Each of the six Alliances identified key stakeholders (e.g., PIs, Co-PIs, staff, partners, researchers, and evaluators) who were in a position to assess progress regarding the design elements. The response rate for the survey was 70 percent (representing 88 of the 126 individuals who were asked to complete the survey).</p>

					<p>The NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub’s Collaborative Infrastructure Survey is designed to document respondents’ assessment of their project’s progress addressing specific components of each design element. The graphics on the site portray survey findings using respondents as the unit of analysis. While this perspective is useful, it fails to consider whether respondents within a given project agreed about the level of progress around the design elements. In addition, there is considerable benefit in considering projects as the unit of analysis (e.g., to assess which design elements projects appear to be addressing in a given year of NSF INCLUDES funding). To address this, we used item-response theory and confirmatory factor analysis to generate project-level composite scores for each survey item.<sup>1</sup> This approach allowed us to assess the extent to which Alliances have operationalized the design element of collaborative infrastructure at a given point in time. <a class="blue strong" href="images/survey-findings.pdf" aria-label="Survey Findings(pdf)" target="_blank">Learn more <i aria-hidden="true" class="fal fa-file-pdf"></i></a> about the methodology used to generate project-level findings.</p>

					<p class="small pt-3">Note: The score for a given survey item represents the overall standardized scale score obtained from the item-response theory and confirmatory factor analysis. Each score has a range of 1 to 100, with 100 representing the highest possible score—i.e., all respondents within a project answered the highest response category (either “achieved” or “strongly agree”) for a given survey item. In addition, we provide the minimum and maximum project-level standardized scale score response <em>(in italics)</em> for a given survey item.</p>

					<p class="small pt-3"><sup>13</sup> These approaches are designed to assess the relationship between the latent construct and observed items to test the reliability and validity of the measurement and quantify the attributes of interest.</p>
					<p class="small"><sup>14</sup> Because the survey was administered for the first time in spring 2021, we presently have no data on respondents’ perceptions of progress at the end of the first year of NSF INLCUDES funding. (Going forward, we expect to obtain Year 1 data from NSF INCLUDES Planning Grants and Cohort 3 Alliances.) As a result, we are currently unable to provide information about the relative progress that respondents would have reported for their initial year.</p>
					<p class="small"><sup>15</sup> In theory, one would expect that Alliances with more years of NSF INCLUDES funding would report more progress around the operationalization of a given design element. However, we are somewhat cautious when making such comparisons, because it is possible that the characteristics of Alliances funded in a given cohort differ (e.g., in terms of the maturity and complexity of their partnership structure, the range of barriers they are designed to address, the characteristics of their participant population, and the complexity of their approach). In addition, respondents’ perspectives concerning their accomplishments (or the progress they still need to make) around a given design element may shift as they recognize the complexity of a given issue—with respondents realizing more work is needed as they begin to delve more deeply into a particular task.</p>
