					<p>Given the breadth of outcomes that Network members are designed to achieve (and the range of methods being used to measure progress toward those outcomes), it is difficult to collect common data that can be aggregated across STEM BP projects. This inventory provides Network members a public space to highlight the various ways they are promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM. Specifically, the inventory represents a catalog of STEM BP outcomes across a range of educational and career pathways.</p>

					<p>The examples and related materials will also serve as a resource for Network members who are seeking information about the range of key STEM BP milestones that might be used to plan and assess their efforts (as well as the tangible ways in which other initiatives are documenting their progress across a comprehensive range of STEM BP outcomes).<button type="button" class="blue strong highlight" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#outcomes">Learn how the findings in this inventory were obtained. <i aria-hidden="true" class="far fa-window-restore"></i></button></p>

CAHSI also held ideation sessions for 54 CAHSI faculty members to strengthen research capacity at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) that lack funding from Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) programs by building collaborations among HSIs and other institutions to plan research projects. Teams of researchers from various CAHSI institutions submitted research proposals to NSF under the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Minority-Serving Institutions Research Expansion program in April 2021. CAHSI further collaborated with the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) on the 2021 NSF CISE-MSI Proposal Development Workshops.</p>
									<p>CAHSI also received a RAPID award in 2021 from NSF to support virtual research experiences (vREU) for CAHSI faculty and students. Faculty received professional development through a virtual platform in the Affinity Research Group model to support students’ growth in professional skills. A total of 21 faculty and 51 students from 14 colleges and universities participated, and posters were submitted to the Great Minds in STEM conference in fall 2020. Each week faculty received professional development to enable them to coach their students on professional skills. In 2021, with residual funding from the RAPID grant, another vREU was launched in June 2021 with 14 faculty and 19 students from 12 universities and colleges.

The <a href="https://www.aspirealliance.org/national-change/inclusive-professional-framework-for-faculty" target="_blank" class="blue">Inclusive Professional Framework for Faculty</a> <b>(IPF: Faculty)</b> identifies three core domains - Identity, Intercultural, and Relational - which underlie inclusive practices in higher education. The IPF: Faculty promotes student success by providing a set of skills in the three domains that can be applied to inclusive practices across faculty roles such as teaching, research mentoring, advising, leadership, and colleagueship. These skills also contribute to health and well-being and inclusive climates within the institution.</p>

									<p><b>Aspire</b>: Aspire's National Change has engaged 84 individuals from 19 institutions in the Aspire Summer Institute, a week-long immersive experience for institutional teams, centered around the <a href="https://www.aspirealliance.org/national-change/inclusive-professional-framework-for-faculty" target="_blank" class="blue">Inclusive Professional Framework for Faculty</a> <b>(IPF: Faculty)</b>, that supports campus diversity, equity, and inclusions efforts through the development of key skills applicable across faculty roles.</p>

									<p><b>Aspire</b>: The IAspire Leadership Academy has supported 44 fellows. The academy elevates the preparedness of academic leaders from underrepresented groups so they can aspire to and succeed in more senior leadership roles. Fellows gain critical leadership skills across numerous competencies and learn how to lead more effectively in increasingly complex environments and build confidence to influence institutional transformation.</p>

									<p><b>First2:</b>  A 2020 survey administered by the First2 Alliance survey found that participants in their summer internship programs (rising college freshmen) had very high ratings for STEM plans, both before and after the internships, with no statistically significant change between the two time periods. (Source: 2020 Evaluation Report p. 96-99)</p>
									<p><b>First2</b> also conducts focus groups of interns and asks if their participation in the program has influenced that decision about a STEM major.  Most interns “noted they had already declared their STEM major but added that it did help them identify contacts within their major, strengthened their desire for a particular STEM major, opened their eyes to new areas of interest within their STEM majors, and provided insights into different fields and research within those fields. A few perceived that it did influence their decisions related to a STEM major.” (Source: 2020 Evaluation Report p. 111)</p>

									<p><b>CAHSI:</b> The CAHSI Alliance reported that the overwhelming majority of their students’ long-term interests, intentions, and career goals remained the same or increased in Year 2, even despite Covid-19. For example, in its 2020 evaluation report, CAHSI noted that students’ long-term interests and intentions remained stable amid the disruptions and campus closures from the pandemic (i.e., 80-85 percent responded “remained the same” or “increased” to the items related to long term interest and intention in computing). Therefore, the vast majority of students maintained or increased their interest in computing and their commitment to a computing career. Students remained more committed to a computing career (only 14 percent had less intention), to a greater degree than they sustained general interest in their major (21 percent did report a loss of interest in the computing major from the pandemic). Because students generally maintained strong intentions in computing, there were no differences in interest or intentions among different student populations or across regions. <em>(Source: 2020 Evaluation Report, p. 69)</em></p>
									<p><b>CAHSI</b> also found that they had a lower self-efficacy in computing, largely attributed to disruptions from the pandemic.  CAHSI also reported: Despite students’ widespread sustained interest in computing, many students did experience lower self-efficacy in computing from the pandemic and campus disruptions, meaning that students experienced a loss of confidence that they could be successful in their coursework and the in the field of computing in general. Students experienced the greatest loss in feeling that they comprehended the computing concepts in their courses (57 percent experienced a decline, mean of 2.39 on 5-point scale, or between “slightly less” and “remained the same”). Perhaps because of their decreased understanding of their coursework, students also reported declines in their ability to maintain their grades (52 percent reported a decline, mean of 2.49). Likewise, a similar number of students experienced declines in their confidence that they could succeed in their coursework. Therefore, about 50 percent-60 percent of students experienced lower confidence and decreased self-efficacy in computing from the pandemic. <em>(Source: 2020 Evaluation Report, p. 69)</em></p>
									<p><b>First2:</b> The First2 Alliance reported positive findings from a number of survey questions students answered about their STEM confidence, skills and knowledge. Specifically, First2 reported that a majority of respondents “strongly agreed” with each of the following statements:
										<ul>
											<li>This experience helped to improve my research skills.</li>
											<li>This experience helped me to increase my knowledge of research within a STEM field.</li>
											<li>This experience helped me to increase my general scientific knowledge.</li>
											<li>This experience helped me learn how STEM research is conducted.</li>
											<li>This experience helped me see myself as someone who can do STEM.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>In focus groups, students reported that "internships improved their confidence to do STEM coursework and that ongoing Network support helped them progress and persist in their STEM studies." (Source: 2020 Evaluation Report, p. 4)</p>

				<p>The structure of the inventory includes <b>Constructs</b> (the broad goals that STEM BP initiatives are designed to achieve), <b>Dimensions</b> (the objectives associated with a given construct), and <b>Indicators of Progress</b> (specific evidence that demonstrate attainment of a given Dimension). These measures represent a continuum of STEM education milestones that STEM BP initiatives seek to achieve. The Constructs, Dimensions, and Indicators are drawn from multiple sources—including literature on broadening participation in STEM, national STEM BP indicators, and indicators used by specific Network members.</p>

				<p>The results presented in the inventory reflect findings outlined in Network members’ annual and evaluation reports. Over time we will also identify project-specific STEM BP outcomes contained in other sources such as journal articles, conference presentations, project websites, and contributions from Network members. Before outcomes are included in the inventory, they are reviewed by Hub staff for completeness, accuracy, and relevance.</p>

				<p>Note that this inventory does not specify (or even suggest) what specific data source should be used to assess progress toward a given outcome. Rather, the assumption is that Network members will use whatever method(s) are most appropriate given the context within which their initiative is being implemented and evaluated.</p>
